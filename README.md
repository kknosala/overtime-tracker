# overtime-tracker
The overtime tracker is a project that is currently on going. It is designed for companies to be able to post available overtime and for agents to be able to apply for the posted overtime. Currently, there are two parts to this app, the agent side and the admin side.
## Components
This project is made of the following languages
- HTML
- CCS
 - Bootstrap
- javascript
 - JQuery
- Firebase
## Pages
There are currently two pages in use for this program
### Agent Page
This page shows all posted overtimes created by the admin. Agents are able to fill in their information to apply for the overtime that is currently available. This information is stored in the firebase database and then displayed on the admin page.
This page can be viewed here: https://kknosala.github.io/overtime-tracker/
### Admin Page
This is the admin page used to create new overtime postings, delete filled postings, and approve or deny current requests. When a request is approved or denied, it is moved into its own section and can be deleted once the records are updated.

## Future Plans
I would like to add some user authentication elements to this project to prevent unauthorized users from accessing the admin page. I would also like to add some way to automatically send email to the agents once their time has been either approved or denied.
